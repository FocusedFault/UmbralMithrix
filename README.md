# Umbral Mithrix

Major reworks to the fight, a new trophy item, and 2 new modes, Practice and Bonfire. When you spawn on the moon there'll be 2 shrines to activate either mode or just don't activate them if you want neither. You only need to interact with them once even if you're using LunarApostles. When completing the fight you'll get a trophy item to track your victories against Umbral.

### Practice Mode

Practice mode just makes you respawn on death in case you want to learn/practice the fight but don't want to do a whole other run (infinite dio's). The trophy item won't spawn at the end of the fight. The mode deactivates after Mithrix dies in Phase 4.

### Bonfire Mode

Bonfire mode saves your drones, money, inventory, and timer when the fight starts and resets your fight on death. So you'll fight Umbral with the same build/allies until you defeat him. Made in case you want to challenge yourself to defeat Umbral but don't want to start a new run. If you die before starting the fight your run ends. The mode deactivates after Mithrix dies in Phase 4. For Multiplayer the reset occurs when all players are dead.

### Config Info

You can edit config values in-game and during runs through Settings -> Mod Options -> UmbralMithrix. Stats are calculated at the start of each phase so you can change in-game configs up until the phase starts. If the in-game values are too limiting you can edit the modman config to input custom values.
