Major reworks to the fight, a new trophy item, and a practice mode. When you spawn on the moon there'll be a shrine to optionally activate the mode. You only need to interact with it once even if you're using LunarApostles. When completing the fight you'll get a trophy item to track your victories against Umbral.

### Practice Mode

Practice mode just makes you respawn on death in case you want to learn/practice the fight but don't want to do a whole other run (infinite dio's). The trophy item won't spawn at the end of the fight. The mode deactivates after Mithrix dies in Phase 4.

### Config Info

You can edit config values in-game and during runs through Settings -> Mod Options -> UmbralMithrix. Stats are calculated at the start of each phase so you can change in-game configs up until the phase starts. If the in-game values are too limiting you can edit the modman config to input custom values.
